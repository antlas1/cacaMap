CacaMap  is a Qt based  map browser widget that works with a bunch of tile servers.

## Build & Run
```bash
# assuming you already have qt4 installed, probably would work with other qt
#versions but haven't tested it.
# this will generate the Makefile
qmake -qt=4
make
./cacamap
```
## Usage
Just add cacaMap to your widget as a child.
If you need to draw anything on top of the map then create
another class that inherits from cacaMap. Implement the paintEvent,
and inside call cacaMap's paintEventHandler and then draw whatever
you want.

```c++
void myDerivedMap::paintEvent(QPaintEvent *e)
{
  cacaMap::paintEvent(e);
  QPainter p(this);
  //you can draw here whatever you want
  //it will show up overlaid on the map
  p.drawSomething(...)
}
```
